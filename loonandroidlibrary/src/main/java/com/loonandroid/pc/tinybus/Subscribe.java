/**
 * Marks a method as an event handler, as used by {@link Bus}.
 *
 * <p>The method's first parameter defines the event type.
 * 
 * <p><b>Main mode</b>
 * <p>If subscriber's <code>mode</code> is undefined or 
 * <code>Mode.Main</code>, then this subscriber will be called 
 * in main bus thread. 
 * 
 * <p><b>Background mode</b>
 * <p>If subscriber's <code>mode</code> is <code>Mode.Background</code>
 * then subscriber will be called in a background thread. 
 * 
 * <p>For subscriber notified in background you can also specify a 
 * <code>queue</code> name. All subscribers with the same 
 * <code>queue</code> name are notified serially, meaning there is
 * only one active (called) subscriber at a time. Different queues 
 * processed in parallel, completely independent of each other. 
 * 
 * <p>This ensures, that database events processed in a one queue 
 * do not get blocked by possibly much slower events processed 
 * in another queue.    
 *
 * <p>You cannot expect, that same queue is always processed by same
 * background thread.
 * 
 * <p>If <code>queue</code> is not specified, then default "global"
 * queue is used.

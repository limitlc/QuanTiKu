/**
 * Dispatches events to listeners, and provides ways for listeners to register themselves.
 *
 * <p>The Bus allows publish-subscribe-style communication between components without requiring
 * the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each other).
 * It is designed exclusively to replace traditional Android in-process event distribution using
 * explicit registration or listeners. It is <em>not</em> a general-purpose publish-subscribe
 * system, nor is it intended for interprocess communication.
 *
 * <h2>Receiving Events</h2>
 * To receive events, an object should:
 * <ol>
 *      <li>Expose a <b>public</b> method, known as the <i>event handler</i>, which accepts
 *      a single argument of the type of event desired;</li>
 *      <li>Mark it with a {@link com.loonandroid.pc.tinybus.Subscribe} annotation;</li>
 *      <li>Pass itself to an Bus instance's {@link #register(Object)} method.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Posting Events</h2>
 * To post an event, simply provide the event object to the {@link #post(Object)} method.
 * The Bus instance will determine the type of event and route it to all registered listeners.
 *
 * <p>Events are routed to all subscribers registered for exactly this type of event. Event's
 * class hierarchy is ignored.
 *
 * <p>When {@code post} is called, all registered subscribers for an event are run in sequence
 * synchronously, so subscribers should be reasonably quick. If an event may trigger an extended
 * process (such as a database load), spawn a thread or queue it for later.
 *
 * <p>You are allowed to post a new event while already handling an event inside a subscriber
 * method. In this case the bus will finalize dispatching of current event first and then a
 * new event will be dispatched.
 *
 * <h2>Handler Methods</h2>
 * Event handler methods must accept only one argument: the event.
 *
 * <p>Handlers should not, in general, throw. If they do, the Bus will wrap the exception
 * and re-throw it.
 *
 * <h2>Producer Methods</h2>
 * Producer methods should accept no arguments and return their event type. When a subscriber
 * is registered for a type that a producer is also already registered for, the subscriber
 * will be called with the return value from the producer. Null values coming from producers
 * are <b>not</b> dispatched to subscribers.
 *
 * <p>This class is <b>not</b> safe for concurrent use. It must be called from a single thread.
